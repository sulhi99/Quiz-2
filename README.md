### Question
~~~ 
1. What will be the output when running the above code?
Meow. I am a cat. My name is Kurre
Woof. I am a dog. My name is Vilma
Meow. I am a cat. My name is Bamse


2. What is meant by polymorphism?
Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. A language that features polymorphism allows developers to program in the general rather than program in the specific.

3. How does polymorphism work in the above program?
As you can see, each of the child classes has a separate implementation for the function area(). This is how polymorphism is generally used. You have different classes with a function of the same name, and even the same parameters, but with different implementations.

4. The method introduceYourself of Animal appears to be never called? Why not?
because the method introduceYourself() in class dog and cat will override the method introduceYourself() in the class Animal/parent class.

5. Comment out the method introduceYourself in Dog. What happens now when you run the program?
Meow.I am a cat. My name is Kurre. 
Moor.I am an animal. 
Meow.I am a cat.My name is Bamse.

6. Where is the name stored for the instances of Cat and Dog? (In what / which classes did you put the instance variable that refers to the name of the animal? Both Cat and Dog, or just in Animal?)
Cat and Dog
7.  How does the code in the test program work?
Dog and Cat class have the same features of Animal. In main class. Animal class has been called in array type and data has been stored. Loop has been used to print out the output .

8.  How does an array work?
Array is container object and contain an element while you assigned a value . Which element has its own numerical indeks.

9.  In the above programs we have used a while loop to step through the array and to get information about the animals. But there is a more appropriate loop statement here. What is it?
for loop.
for(int i = 0 ; i < allAnimals.length ; i++){ }
